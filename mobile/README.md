# CoachFit Mobile

Status: iOS app integration is planned but not yet shipped. The mobile client will pair with the CoachFit web app and sync HealthKit data for clients who opt in.

## What the iOS App Will Do

- Pair a client device to a CoachFit account using a one-time code generated by a coach.
- Read HealthKit data (workouts, steps, sleep, weight, height) and sync it to CoachFit.
- Show data source indicators so clients and coaches can see HealthKit vs manual entries.
- Keep manual check-ins available in the web app for subjective metrics.
