## Working with Your Coach

### Coach Assignment

- Your coach will invite you via email (if enabled) or add you directly to a cohort
- Once assigned, you'll be able to start logging entries
- You can be part of multiple cohorts if your coach manages different programs

### Communication Model

CoachFit is designed around a **data-driven interaction model**:

1. **You check in regularly** - Log your progress data (weight, steps, calories, etc.)
2. **Your coach reviews weekly** - They review your data to track progress and identify patterns
3. **Your coach provides guidance** - Based on your data, your coach can provide feedback, adjustments, and personalized recommendations

This model reduces the need for constant back-and-forth communication while ensuring your coach has the data they need to help you succeed.

### Coach Notes

Your coach may add notes to your weekly progress. These notes may include:
- Feedback on your progress
- Suggestions for adjustments
- Encouragement and motivation
- Questions about your data
