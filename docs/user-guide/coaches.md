Filter your client list by:

## Managing Cohorts

### What is a Cohort?

A cohort is a group of clients working on a similar program or goal. Cohorts help you:

- Organize clients into logical groups
- Track group performance
- Manage program-specific settings
- View cohort-level analytics

### Creating a Cohort

1. Click the "Create Cohort" button on your dashboard
2. Enter a name for your cohort (e.g., "Spring 2024 Fitness Challenge")
3. Configure check-in prompts (optional):
    - Enable/disable specific prompts (weight, steps, calories, sleep quality, perceived effort)
    - Add custom prompts if needed
4. Click "Create Cohort"
5. Your new cohort will appear in your cohorts list

### Cohort Settings

Each cohort can have custom check-in configurations:

- **Enabled Prompts** - Choose which data fields clients should track
- **Custom Prompts** - Add your own questions or data points
- **Prompt Types** - Scale (1-10), text, or number

### Viewing Cohorts

- Navigate to the "Cohorts" section from the sidebar
- See all your cohorts with client counts
- Click on a cohort to view details and analytics

When viewing a cohort's detail page, you can:

- **Search Active Clients** - Use the search bar to find clients by name or email within the cohort
- View all clients in the cohort
- See pending invitations
- Configure check-in prompts
- Add or remove clients
- View cohort analytics

### Cohort Organization Tips

- Use descriptive names (e.g., "January Weight Loss Program")
- Organize by program, goal, or timeline
- Keep cohorts focused (3-10 clients per cohort works well)
- Create separate cohorts for different programs

---

## Inviting Clients

### Two Invitation Methods

1. **Invite to Specific Cohort** - Invite a client directly to a cohort (recommended)
2. **Global Invite** - Invite a client who will be assigned to a cohort later

### How to Invite a Client

1. Click "Invite Client" on your dashboard
2. Enter the client's email address
3. Choose whether to:
    - Assign them to a specific cohort immediately
    - Create a global invite (assign to cohort later)
4. Click "Send Invitation"
5. The client will receive an email (if email notifications are enabled) with instructions

### After Inviting

- The client will appear in your client list with "Pending" status
- Once they sign up, they'll be automatically assigned to the cohort (if you specified one)
- You'll be able to see their entries once they start logging

### Client Assignment

After inviting a client with a global invite:

1. They'll appear in your client list as "Unassigned"
2. Use the "Assign to Cohort" dropdown next to their name
3. Select the cohort and confirm
4. They'll now be part of that cohort
